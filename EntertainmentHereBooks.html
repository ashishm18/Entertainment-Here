    <h2><b>1. Small Move, Big Change</b></h2>
    <h3><b>By: Caroling Arnold</b></h3>

      Have you ever promised yourself that this school year you won’t leave
      writing your term paper until the last minute, just to forget about your
      resolution as soon as term started? Why did you struggle to stick to your
      new resolution?
    </p>
    <p>
      Caroline Arnold dives into this question in her book, Small Move, Big
      Change, discovering that most of us fail at keeping our resolutions
      because they are too vague and too big.
    </p>
    <p>
      By incorporating ‘microresolutions,’ tiny behavioural modifications, into
      our daily habits, we can achieve lasting change in virtually any area of
      our lives. It all comes down to identifying our habits and external cues
      that can be linked to tiny resolutions that stick because they are so easy
      to achieve. This is an essential read for anyone wanting to change their
      habits.

    <h2><b>2. The Last Lecture</b></h2>
    <h3><b>By: Randy Pausch</b></h3>

    <p>
      What would you talk about if you knew you only had a few months left?
      That’s the question Professor Randy Pausch had to answer a month after
      being diagnosed with terminal cancer.
    </p>
    <p>
      This booked is based on his now iconic lecture, called “Really Achieving
      Your Childhood Dreams” and challenges his students and readers to think
      back to their own childhood dreams, and what their biggest hopes and
      desires for their life were then.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he doesn’t suggest you join the circus or try to become an
      astronaut, he urges you to pursue the life you truly desire, without
      limiting yourself to the constraints of society or what you’re “supposed
      to do.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The book complements the lecture with added stories from Pausch’s own
      childhood that he wanted to pass on to his children.

    <h2><b>3. The Happiness Project</b></h2>
    <h3><b>By Gretchen Rubin</b></h3>
    <img

    />
    <p>
      Since publishing this bestselling book, Gretchen Rubin has become known as
      somewhat of a happiness expert. Most people agree that the most important
      thing in life is to strive for happiness, and most parents would even say
      their biggest hope for their kids it that they are happy. So how come
      prioritising our own happiness is so often seen as selfish in today’s
      world?
    </p>
    <p>
      After realising that she wasn’t as happy as she should be, considering her
      life was going pretty well, Rubin decided to study happiness and dedicated
      a whole year of her life to her “happiness project.” She focused on 12
      different areas of her life and methodically tracked habits and behaviours
      that increased her happiness. While “everyone’s happiness project will be
      different,” Rubin gives readers a blueprint to create their own happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is essential reading for everyone who wants to actively understand
      what makes them happy and how they can improve their life according to
      their values of happiness.

        >4. Failing Forward: Turning Mistakes into Stepping Stones For
        Success</b

    <h3><b>By: John C. Maxwell</b></h3>

    <p>
      We are taught early on to avoid failure at all costs. You don’t want to be
      a loser, right? But the truth is that everyone fails at some point in
      their life. The question isn’t whether we will fail, but how we will deal
      with our failures? John C. Maxwell writes: “When achievers fail, they see
      it as a momentary event, not a lifelong epidemic.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Only by owning up to and learning from our failures can we grow as people,
      in business and in relationships. The most successful people have failed
      over and over again. James Dyson invented 5,126 prototypes before he built
      his first commercially successful vacuum cleaner. He used his failures as
      stepping stones towards success. This book will teach you to observe your
      failures, analyse them, and learn from them.

    <p>
      Never have we been surrounded by more technology fighting to grab our
      attention than now. Smart phones, social media, notifications, the average
      attention span of a human has shrunk to that of the notoriously unfocused
      gold fish. There are even apps created to helping us with our lack of
      focus, adding another layer of distraction to our everyday lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      In The Attention Revolution, Wallace shares some techniques to attain the
      highest form of Shamatha, a Buddhist meditation state of mind. While it’s
      near impossible to achieve in just one lifetime, using some of the lessons
      shared, you will be able to take control of your attention again, to focus
      on anything you set your mind to, whether you’re studying for an exam, or
      practicing a hobby or sport.

    <h2><b>6. Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity</b></h2>
    <h3><b>By: David Allen</b></h3>
    <img
      src="https://www.opencolleges.edu.au/informed/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/image-7.jpg"
    />
    <p>
      Granted, the title of this book might not capture your imagination, but if
      you read one book about productivity in your life, then make it this one.
    </p>
    <p>
      The basic principle behind the Getting Things Done, or GTD method, is the
      idea that you should get all your thoughts and tasks out of your mind so
      they don’t clutter your headspace. First, apply the 2-minute rule. If a
      task takes less than 2 minutes to complete, do it now. If it takes longer,
      follow a simple five-step workflow: capture, clarify, organise, reflect,
      and engage. By following these two principles you can virtually take
      control of all projects and tasks in your life. Sound simple? That’s
      because it is. You can start applying it to school work, hobbies, and any
      other projects right away.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the original book was published in 2001, Allen has kept it updated
      and relevant to today’s busy and noisy world of multi-tasking, email, and
      social media.

    <h2><b>7. The 4-Hour Workweek</b></h2>
    <h3><b>By: Tim Ferriss</b></h3>
    <img
      src="https://www.opencolleges.edu.au/informed/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/image-3.jpg"
    />
    <p>
      Since its publication in 2007, The 4-Hour Workweek has been heavily
      criticised by some, while becoming something of a business and lifestyle
      bible for others. The main premise is that the traditional concept of
      retirement, deferred gratification, and the 9-to-5 is outdated and that
      there’s no reason to wait until you’re old to enjoy yourself, especially
      in these difficult economic times.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the title can be somewhat misleading, there are many valuable
      lessons to be learned. Ferriss shares how he managed to reduce his working
      hours to just 4 per week by automating and outsourcing large chunks of his
      business, while increasing his income from $40,000 per year to $40,000 per
      month.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even if you’re not interested in becoming an entrepreneur, you’ll learn
      about productivity, time management, and learning techniques—and most
      importantly, the concept of lifestyle design and how you can take control
      over what your life looks like.

    <h2><b>8. Lean In</b></h2>
    <h3><b>By: Sheryl Sandberg</b></h3>
    <img
      src="https://www.opencolleges.edu.au/informed/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/image-8.jpg"
    />
    <p>
      Celebrated as a modern feminist manifesto, Sandberg’s book Lean In should
      be essential reading for both female and male students. The chief
      operating officer at Facebook and former Google executive shares her own
      experiences as well as those of other women in high corporate positions,
      encouraging women to “lean in” and claim their seat at the table. Instead
      of simply bemoaning the current state of affairs, she gives concrete
      advice on how women can break the limiting patterns they face in the
      working world. Don’t check out of your career early just because you’re
      planning to have kids, find a partner who is willing to support your
      career, forget the unrealistic concept of “having it all,” and start
      taking more risks. Both men and women will find invaluable lessons in
      leadership that will help you maneuver your future career.
    </p>
    <p>
      In her latest book, Lean In for Graduates Sandberg has added a few
      chapters specific to job applications and salary negotiations.

    <h2><b>9. How to Win Friends and Influence People</b></h2>
    <h3><b>By: Dale Carnegie</b></h3>
    <p>
      Originally published in 1936, the lessons of Dale Carnegie’s classic
      self-help book still ring true to this day. No matter if you’re in high
      school, college or at any stage of your career, understanding how to
      connect with other people is one of the greatest lessons you can learn.
      This book will teach you how to navigate relationships, have meaningful
      conversations with anyone you talk to, and win over people who think
      differently to you. Especially in today’s world of online influencers and
      social media, it’s more important than ever to learn how to be influential
      in your career and social life.

        >10. Rich Dad, Poor Dad: Whatthe Rich Teach Their Kids about Money That
        the Poor and Middle Class Do Not!</b
      >
    </h2>
    <h3><b>By: Robert R. Kiyosaki</b></h3>
    <p>
      One of the most neglected areas in the traditional schooling system is
      financial education. According to a 2016 study, nearly two thirds of
      Americans are financially illiterate, meaning they can’t answer simple
      questions about money, debt and investing.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Rich Dad, Poor Dad Kiyosaki shares his experience growing up with two
      father figures who had virtually opposing views on finances and money.
      Although both dads earned well, one managed to invest well and leave an
      inheritance for his kids, while the other struggled with money his whole
      life. Kiyosaki narrows down what he learned from his “rich dad” to six
      fundamental lessons about money that everybody should know.
    </p>
    <p>
      This book will transform the way you think about and handle money for the
      rest of your life.
