      <p>
        FIFA (/ˈfiːfə/ French: Fédération Internationale de Football
        Association, English: International Federation of Association Football,
        Spanish: Federación Internacional de Fútbol Asociación; German:
        Internationaler Verband des Association Fußball) is a non-profit
        organization which describes itself as an international governing body
        of association football, futsal and beach soccer. It is the highest
        governing body of association football.
      </p>
      <p>
        FIFA was founded in 1904 to oversee international competition among the
        national associations of Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, the
        Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland. Headquartered in Zürich,
        Switzerland, its membership now comprises 211 national associations.
        These national associations must each also be members of one of the six
        regional confederations into which the world is divided: Africa, Asia,
        Europe, North & Central America and the Caribbean, Oceania, and South
        America

      <h2>Laliga</h2>
      <p>
        The Campeonato Nacional de Liga de Primera División,[a] commonly known
        simply as La Liga[b] and officially as LaLiga Santander for sponsorship
        reasons,[2] stylized as LaLiga, is the men's top professional football
        division of the Spanish football league system.[3] Administered by the
        Liga Nacional de Fútbol Profesional,[c] is contested by 20 teams, with
        the three lowest-placed teams at the end of each season relegated to the
        Segunda División and replaced by the top two teams and a play-off winner
        in that division.
      </p>
      <p>
        A total of 62 teams have competed in La Liga since its inception. Nine
        teams have been crowned champions, with Real Madrid winning the title a
        record 34 times and Barcelona 26 times. During the 1940s Valencia,
        Atlético Madrid and Barcelona emerged as the strongest clubs, winning
        several titles. Real Madrid and Barcelona dominated the championship in
        the 1950s, each winning four La Liga titles during the decade. During
        the 1960s and 1970s Real Madrid dominated La Liga, winning 14 titles,
        with Atlético Madrid winning four. During the 1980s and 1990s Real
        Madrid were prominent in La Liga, but the Basque clubs of Athletic Club
        and Real Sociedad had their share of success, each winning two Liga
        titles. From the 1990s onward, Barcelona have dominated La Liga winning
        16 titles to date. Although Real Madrid has been prominent, winning nine
        titles, La Liga has also seen other champions, including Atlético
        Madrid, Valencia, and Deportivo La Coruña.

      <h2>UEFA Europe League</h2>
      <p>
        The UEFA Europa League (abbreviated as UEL) is an annual football club
        competition organised by the Union of European Football Associations
        (UEFA) for eligible European football clubs. It is the second-tier
        competition of European club football, ranking below the UEFA Champions
        League and above the UEFA Europa Conference League after being the
        third-tier competition from 1971 to 1999 before the UEFA Cup Winners'
        Cup was discontinued.[1][2] Clubs qualify for the competition based on
        their performance in their national leagues and cup competitions.

      <h2>Premier League</h2>
      <p>
        The Premier League, often referred to exonymously as the English Premier
        League or the EPL (legal name: The Football Association Premier League
        Limited), is the top level of the English football league system.
        Contested by 20 clubs, it operates on a system of promotion and
        relegation with the English Football League (EFL). Seasons run from
        August to May with each team playing 38 matches (playing all 19 other
        teams both home and away).[1] Most games are played on Saturday and
        Sunday afternoons.
      </p>
      <p>
        The competition was founded as the FA Premier League on 20 February 1992
        following the decision of clubs in the Football League First Division to
        break away from the Football League, founded in 1888, and take advantage
        of a lucrative television rights deal. The deal was worth around £1
        billion a year domestically as of 2013–14, with Sky and BT Group
        securing the domestic rights to broadcast 116 and 38 games respectively.
        The league is a corporation in which the member clubs act as
        shareholders, and generates €2.2 billion per year in domestic and
        international television rights.Clubs were apportioned central payment
        revenues of £2.4 billion in 2016–17, with a further £343 million in
        solidarity payments to English Football League (EFL) clubs.

      <h2>UEFA Champions League</h2>
      <p>
        The UEFA Champions League (abbreviated as UCL) is an annual club
        football competition organised by the Union of European Football
        Associations (UEFA) and contested by top-division European clubs,
        deciding the competition winners through a round robin group stage to
        qualify for a double-legged knockout format, and a single leg final. It
        is one of the most prestigious football tournaments in the world and the
        most prestigious club competition in European football, played by the
        national league champions (and, for some nations, one or more
        runners-up) of their national associations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Introduced in 1955 as the Coupe des Clubs Champions Européens (French
        for European Champion Clubs' Cup), and commonly known as the European
        Cup, it was initially a straight knockout tournament open only to the
        champions of Europe's domestic leagues, with its winner reckoned as the
        European club champion. The competition took on its current name in
        1992, adding a round-robin group stage in 1991 and allowing multiple
        entrants from certain countries since 1997.
