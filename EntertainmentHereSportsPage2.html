      <h2>1 Headingley Test 2019 (Ashes)</h2>
      <p>
        Headingley. Botham. Stokes. Sits comfortably. One of the great innings
        you will ever see. England won it as much as Australia lost it. There is
        no greater sport than test cricket. May it long survive.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was lost when England crumbled out for 67. It was lost when they had
        to chase down a 359-run never-done-before mountain. It was lost when Roy
        and Rory did nothing to strengthen the chase. It was lost when Root fell
        early this morning. It was lost when Stokes sold Buttler down the river.
        It was lost when Archer thought it to be wise to slog them around for
        fun. It was lost when Broad couldn't keep out a yorker. It was lost when
        Leach brain-exploded a single-that-wasn't. It was lost when Stokes swept
        himself plumb. Alas, it wasn't. It was won.

        Anyone still in favour of four-day Tests? Didn't think so. A scorecard
        entry of 6* off 60, doesn't show flying stem-guards, broken fingers, and
        wincing warriors. Fours, sixes and strike-rates don't stand a chance in
        the face of the grit and clarity required in the five-day game. The
        romanticism of Test cricket, the contrast of sheer panache and grit, the
        coexistence and codependence of the Pujaras and the Pants of the world
        is what we live for - the euphoria, the heartbreak, the "umpire's call"
        bruises that hurt more if you lose, but don't hurt if you win. For
        Australia, it was their first choice, whereas India had their last
        eleven men standing - and they emerged victorious. They complained about
        the bubble alright, but when they were let out of it, they cut loose and
        gave it their all, didn't they?

      <h2>Ind vs Nz 2020 T20I series</h2>
      <p>
        Virat Kohli marches onto the field and so does the Indian team. They are
        pumped, Indians in the crowd are pumped. It's been a stunning match. And
        can you believe it, New Zealand have lost another super-over. Another
        heartbreak for them. They had it under control in the final over when
        they required 2 off 4 balls. But they crumbled then and ended up making
        only 1 run in the last four balls. In the super over, KW was superb
        again. A six and a four from him enabled them to post India a target of
        18. One thought, it's gonna be too much for India. One surely thought
        that when India required 10 off the last two balls. But Rohit Sharma
        under pressure was sensational. He smashed back to back sixes to notch
        up a memorable victory for India. And they won their first T20I series
        in New Zealand in the most extraordinary fashion.

      <h2>Indian premier League</h2>
      <p>
        The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional Twenty20 cricket
        league, contested by eight teams based out of eight different Indian
        cities. The league was founded by the Board of Control for Cricket in
        India (BCCI) in 2007. It is usually held between March and May of every
        year and has an exclusive window in the ICC Future Tours Programme.
      </p>
      <p>
        The IPL is the most-attended cricket league in the world and in 2014 was
        ranked sixth by average attendance among all sports leagues. In 2010,
        the IPL became the first sporting event in the world to be broadcast
        live on YouTube. The brand value of the IPL in 2019 was ₹475 billion
        (US$6.7 billion), according to Duff & Phelps. According to BCCI, the
        2015 IPL season contributed ₹11.5 billion (US$160 million) to the GDP of
        the Indian economy.
      </p>
      <p>
        There have been thirteen seasons of the IPL tournament. The current IPL
        title holders are the Mumbai Indians, who won the 2020 season.[10] The
        venue for the 2020 season was moved due to the COVID-19 pandemic and
        games were played in the United Arab Emirates.
